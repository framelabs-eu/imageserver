# ArtFrame Image Server

This tool can serve arbitrary images to ArtFrames in **Mode: WiFi** with firmware _1.4_ or above.

4 bit grayscale PNG files with equal dimension to that of your ArtFrame display resolution are served as-is. All other images are cropped, resized and dithered.

| âš  NOTE |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Although arbitrary image formats [[1]](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/handbook/image-file-formats.html) and sizes are supported, for best visual results and performance, you should prepare your images manually before serving them.** |

# Usage

1. Run ```./imageserver.py [path to image files]```
2. Configure the ArtFrame to use the IP and port of the machine that imageserver.py was started on. Example: "http://framelabs.eu:8090/"
